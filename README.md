The idea for this website came about through my own experiences as a Mum and needing to find the nearest public toilet quickly whilst out with both babies in nappies 
and older children who can't wait. As well as knowing where the nearest toilet was, I felt that being able to make sure that the toilets had the facilities that you require 
would also be a useful feature. For example, knowing in advance that the baby changing facilities can only be accessed from within the ladies' toilets is critically important
for fathers.

I believed that the site should be kept simple so that people did not have to contend with complex navigation when they needed to get the information in a hurry. 

The contact form enables the site to be kept up to date through users updating the available amenities, and also allows for the expansion of the site to other 
places through user interaction. 


## User Experience (UX)

* **User Stories** 
    * **First Time User Goals**
        1. As a first time user, I will want to look to find where the nearest toilet is when in an area I do not know
        2. As a first time user, I will want to be able to use the maps feature to look for the fastest way to get to the toilet
        3. As a first time user, I will want to look at the amenities of a toilet to make sure that it will suit my needs before I get there

    * **Returning User Goals**
        1. I will want to help to update the site with any changes to the toilest that I frequently visit
        2. I will want to be able to plan ahead on trips out to make sure that local toilets have the facilities that I need
    
    * **Frequent User Goals**
        1. I will want to use the contact form to help to build and improve the site
        2. I will want to plan ahead and look for toilets in areas that I am planning on visiting

## Design

### Colour Scheme

According to colour psychology, green is one of the most calming colours. Due to the nature of the site, when people may be visiting it in a panic, 
I wanted to avoid the use of any stress inducing colours, such as red tones.

I have kept the colour scheme simple, with just 4 colours in use throughout the site. To make the site easier on the eyes, and again to 
create a more calming site, I have avoided having a white background and black text. Instead I have opted for dark grey text and an off white background. 
This avoids having too great a contrast on the site which can be harder on the eyes.

### Typography

I have kept to one simple font throughout the site, Late, with a backup font of sans serif. This is a clean and easy to use font, which will make the 
content easier to read.

### Imagery


### Wireframes

The wireframes for this site were created in balsamiq and uploaded as a PDF. They can be found as a PDF file [here](documentation/toileting-toddlers-pdf.pdf)

Some amendments were made to the wireframes once I started to build the site. Originally the site was called toileting toddlers as its primary use was to be an aid for parents
of toddlers who were toilet training. However I realised that this would limit its audience and therefore change the site to Locate a Loo. 

## Features

### Existing Features

#### 1. Images

The front page contains a slideshow of images, designed to draw the eye and make the front page eye catching and interesting to look at.

#### 2. Front Page content

The content on the front page enables uses to quickly see what the site is about, and will be used to include keywords to enable to site to improve its SEO.

![](./documentation/screenshot-front-page-content.png)

#### 3. Map content

The content on the map page gives a clear guide to how to use the maps. This is important for anyone that may not be used to how google maps works.

#### 4. Map 

The map enables people to look for their location and see where the nearest public conveniences area

#### 5. Map Pop-Up Boxes

Once the user has found their nearest toilet, they will be able to click on the flag to find out the full address, and the facilities that are availble. This 
will enable them to check that they are going to a toilet that best suits their needs.

#### 6. Contact Form

User interaction is critical in order to help build out the site. The contact form will enable the current featured toilets to be kept up-yo-date with any changes
reported, and ultimately, the site can then be a nationwide site with public help. This will then mean that it can be used for checking ahead before a day out. 

### Features Left to Implement

#### 1. Search Function

The ability to search by postcode or current location will help with making the site easier to navigate.

#### 2. Directions

Incorporating a feature which gives directions to the public conveniences will also make the site far more user friendly.

#### 3. Ratings

In the future, I would like to incorporate a cleanliness rating into the site. This will help with user interaction and 
enable people to avoid toilets that have been rated as unclean.

#### 4. Breastfeeding guide

On either a separate page, or incorporated into the existing map page, in the future I would like to incorporate details on breastfeeding 
friendly locations.

##### 5. Filter Features

The ability to be able to filter the listed toilets would help the user experience. For example, showing only toilets that are accessible by car, or that 
the baby change facilities are accessible to all.
